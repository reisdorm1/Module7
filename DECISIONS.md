The refactoring focused on improving readability and maintainability by applying descriptive naming conventions and clear docstrings. Renaming variables and functions to better reflect their purpose makes the code self-documenting, reducing the amount of context a future reader needs. Adding docstrings provides standardized explanations that are consistent with PEP 257 and helpful for tools like IDEs and documentation generators.

List comprehensions replaced manual loops to make the code more concise and idiomatic, which aligns with common Python practices for transforming iterables. They also reduce boilerplate and make the intent of operations easier to understand at a glance. Inline comments were added selectively to clarify logic where necessary without cluttering the code.
